    "Please read the tasks description carefully and implement **only** what the tasks wants you to implement. Follow the instructions from the task description. There might be tasks that require you to write things you would do differently **but** you have to stay with the description. The test cases below each input cell is the gold standard. For this assignment, you do not need any error handling, you can assume that all input to your function will be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this or any other assignment, using `print` is encouraged to test your implementation but is is **never** required to use it. If your function has to **return** something, use the `return` statement. A `print` is **not** a `return`.\n",

    "Try to implement the tasks yourself or in a small team. If you blindly copy a solution from the internet or other students, you will not learn anything from it. Understand the solution! This takes practice.\n",
